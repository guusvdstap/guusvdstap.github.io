# My additional comments:
# You can name the repo whatever you like, but keep in mind that the name of the GitHub page then will be: https://<username>.github.io/<reponame>
# Don't follow the steps mentioned on GitHub's new repo page
# You can find the url git@github.com: on GitHub's new repo page.
# First username is the GitHub username. Second username is the username of the repo.

# When you want to push a new post to GitHub, follow these steps.
#
#Optional: List all files in local git repo to check current dependencies
#    $ git ls-tree -r main --name-only
#
#Commit changes on local git repo

#
#Enter the commit message for your changes
